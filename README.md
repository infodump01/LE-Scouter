Arrows on profiles are an indicator of RISK
Risk goes from left to right, far left = less risk to attack and far right = more risk to attack
RED = High Risk
YELLOW = Moderate Risk
GREEN = Low Risk
A highlighted risk arrow = account is currently wounded

At 100% the algo suggests that you are about equal in power and thus moderate risk. 50% is very dangerous, and 150% should be relatively easy and not risky to attack. The account below is about equal in power, and is already wounded as indicated by the Red border and warning symbol
